# Security Policy

## Status: testnet only, unaudited

This backend talks to OracleDesk contracts deployed on Stellar **testnet
only**. Nothing has been professionally audited. Don't run it with mainnet
funds or keys. See [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md) for what is and isn't
verified.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report privately, not in a public issue:

- [GitHub Security Advisories](../../security/advisories/new) for this
  repository, or
- email **SECURITY-CONTACT-TBD@example.invalid**
  <!-- TODO(maintainer): replace with the real private disclosure address. -->

<!-- TODO(maintainer): state a triage/response timeline once you have one. -->

In scope, for example:

- Logging in as an address you don't control (`/auth/challenge`, `/auth/verify`).
- Getting a subscription without a matching on-chain USDC transfer, or
  reusing someone else's payment (`payment-verification.service.ts`).
- Reaching an admin endpoint without being in `ADMIN_ADDRESSES`.
- Making the backend sign or submit a transaction in `dry-run` mode, or on
  a network other than testnet in `live` mode.
- A trace marked verified whose bytes don't match the on-chain hash.
- Secrets in logs or API responses.

Out of scope: the contracts (report to
[OracleDesk-SmartContract](https://github.com/OracleDesk/OracleDesk-SmartContract)),
the frontend (report to
[OracleDesk-Frontend](https://github.com/OracleDesk/OracleDesk-Frontend)), and
third-party dependencies unless this repo's use of them is what's
exploitable.
