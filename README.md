# OracleDesk Backend

OracleDesk is an AI prediction-market terminal. Agents propose markets and trade them on Stellar, and every decision ships with a reasoning trace whose hash is recorded on-chain so anyone can check it. This repo is the API, the Stellar event indexer and the LLM pipeline. It handles wallet login and subscriptions, and creates markets and agent trades through the treasury contract (dry-run by default).

> **Testnet only, unaudited.** See [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md) for what is verified.

## How the three repos fit

| Repo | Role |
|---|---|
| [OracleDesk-SmartContract](https://github.com/OracleDesk/OracleDesk-SmartContract) | Soroban contracts, generated TypeScript bindings, testnet deployment, the x402 trace service. **Source of truth.** Pinned here as the `contracts` submodule. |
| **OracleDesk-Backend** (this repo) | API ([docs/api.md](docs/api.md)), indexer, agents. |
| [OracleDesk-Frontend](https://github.com/OracleDesk/OracleDesk-Frontend) | Next.js web app. Reads contracts directly, signs with the user's wallet. |

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 LTS (`.nvmrc`). Built and tested here with Node 24.13.1 and npm 11.8.0; CI uses Node 22.
- npm 10 or later.
- Docker with Compose, for the local PostgreSQL 16 and Redis 7 in `docker-compose.yml` (or your own servers).
- Optional: LLM keys (Anthropic or Gemini) for market generation, Pinata credentials for IPFS pinning, and NewsAPI or FRED credentials for news and macro signals. The server boots without them.
- Optional: the [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/cli) 27+ to cross-check contract state.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OracleDesk/OracleDesk-Backend.git
cd OracleDesk-Backend
git submodule update --init      # if you cloned without --recurse-submodules
nvm use
npm ci
npm run sync:contracts           # no-op unless the submodule moved
docker compose up -d             # Postgres on 127.0.0.1:5433, Redis on 6379
cp .env.example .env             # works as-is with the Compose services
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev                      # http://localhost:8000
```

Then, in another terminal, `scripts/smoke.sh` checks health, wallet login with a throwaway key, the market list and a live testnet read.

The server boots without LLM, Pinata or data-source keys; market generation and IPFS pinning fail until you add them. With an empty `JWT_SECRET` / `AUTH_SIGNING_SECRET` it generates throwaway ones per process and warns, so set real ones for anything shared.

## Configuration

All variables are listed and explained in [.env.example](.env.example). Everything defaults to Stellar Testnet and the contract ids in the synced deployments file. Config is validated at startup by `src/config/index.ts`; a bad or missing value stops the server with the variable's name. Never commit `.env`.

Key switches:

- `CHAIN_EXECUTION_MODE=dry-run` (default): every contract write is built and simulated, logged, and never signed. `live` signs with `AGENT_SECRET_KEY` and is refused on any network but testnet.
- `PAYMENTS_RECIPIENT`: where daily-pass payments must go. Defaults to the treasury contract; see [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md) before relying on that.
- `ADMIN_ADDRESSES`: G-addresses allowed to trigger market generation.

## API at a glance

The full contract with the frontend, including request and response shapes, error codes and the socket.io payloads, is [docs/api.md](docs/api.md). All routes are under `/api/v1` and return `{ ok, data, error, meta? }`. On-chain ids are decimal strings, and on-chain amounts are 7-decimal base-unit strings ending in `Raw`.

| Area | Endpoints |
|---|---|
| Health | `GET /health` |
| Auth | `POST /auth/challenge`, `POST /auth/verify` (signed challenge transaction → JWT) |
| Markets | `GET /markets`, `GET /markets/:id`, `GET /markets/on-chain/:onChainMarketId`, `GET /markets/on-chain/:onChainMarketId/state` (live from the chain), `POST /markets/generate` (admin), `GET /markets/generation-status/:jobId` |
| Traces | `GET /traces`, `GET /traces/:id`, `POST /traces/verify`, `POST /traces/:id/unlock` (daily pass, verified on-chain), `GET`/`PUT /traces/access/allowance`, `GET /traces/payments` |
| Portfolio | `GET /portfolio`, `GET /portfolio/positions`, `GET /portfolio/stats` |
| Copy trade | `POST /trade/copy`, `PATCH /trade/copy/:id/confirm` |
| Resolution | `GET /oracle/markets/:marketId/resolution` (read-only; outcomes are decided on-chain) |
| Realtime | socket.io events `TRADE_EXECUTED`, `REASONING_PUBLISHED` (from the indexer) |

## Scripts

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Dev server with reload |
| `npm run build` / `npm start` | Compile to `dist/` / build and run |
| `npm test` | Compile and run `tests/*.test.ts` with `node:test` |
| `npm run sync:contracts` | Copy generated contract code from `contracts/` into `src/generated/` |
| `npm run check:contracts` | Fail if `src/generated/` is stale (CI runs this) |
| `npm run prisma:migrate` | `prisma migrate dev` |
| `scripts/smoke.sh` | Smoke test a running server (health, login, markets, live chain read) |
| `docker compose up -d` / `down` | Start / stop local Postgres and Redis |
