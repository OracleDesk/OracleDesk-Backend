# Contributing to the OracleDesk backend

Thanks for helping. This is a testnet-only, unaudited project; see
[docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md) for what works today.

## Setup

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OracleDesk/OracleDesk-Backend.git
cd OracleDesk-Backend
nvm use                      # Node 22 (see .nvmrc)
npm ci
docker compose up -d         # local Postgres (127.0.0.1:5433) and Redis (6379)
cp .env.example .env         # works as-is with the Compose services
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev
```

Forgot `--recurse-submodules`? Run `git submodule update --init`.

## Branches and commits

- Branch names: `feat/…`, `fix/…`, `docs/…`, `chore/…`, `test/…`.
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat:`,
  `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`. One logical change per
  commit.
- No force-pushes to shared branches.

## Checks (CI runs exactly these)

```bash
npm run check:contracts     # generated contract code matches the submodule
npx prisma migrate deploy   # against a scratch database
npm run build
npm test
```

With a server running, `scripts/smoke.sh` checks health, wallet login with
a throwaway key, market listing and a live testnet read.

## Database changes

Edit `prisma/schema.prisma`, then `npx prisma migrate dev --name <what>`.
Migrations are forward-only: never edit one that has been merged. If a
migration changes data (not just shape), say so in the PR and in a comment
at the top of the SQL.

## Chain writes

Anything that signs must go through `src/services/chain.service.ts`, which
routes agent writes through the treasury (so its on-chain caps apply) and
does nothing but simulate unless `CHAIN_EXECUTION_MODE=live`. Never call
`market_core.buy` with the agent key, never add a code path that signs in
`dry-run`, and keep live mode testnet-only.

## When the contracts change

The contracts live in
[OracleDesk-SmartContract](https://github.com/OracleDesk/OracleDesk-SmartContract)
and are the source of truth. This repo pins them as the `contracts`
submodule and copies the generated code into `src/generated/`.

```bash
git -C contracts fetch origin
git -C contracts checkout <new commit>
npm run sync:contracts
npm run build && npm test   # tests/categories.test.ts fails if the Category enum changed
git add contracts src/generated
```

Never edit `src/generated/` by hand. If an event or entrypoint changed,
update `src/services/indexer.service.ts` / `chain.service.ts` and
`tests/fixtures/events.json`. If you think a contract needs
to change, write it up in [docs/contract-requests.md](docs/contract-requests.md)
and open the issue in the contracts repo.

## Working on a Drips Wave issue

This repo takes part in [Drips Wave](https://docs.drips.network/wave/).
Per the current Drips docs:

1. Find the issue on the Drips Wave **Explore** page (or in this repo's
   issues once a maintainer has added it to a Wave).
2. **Apply** for it on Drips. Don't start coding until a maintainer assigns
   you; the issue isn't yours before that.
3. Open a PR that links the issue (`Closes #123`).
4. Points are earned when the PR is merged and the issue is marked resolved
   **before the Wave ends**. Complexity (Trivial 100 / Medium 150 /
   High 200 points) is set by the maintainer; if an issue turns out harder
   than labelled, say so on the issue before it's resolved.

Drips also limits how many issues one person can be assigned per
organization in a Wave; check the Drips docs for the current numbers.
Issue drafts live in [docs/wave-issues/](docs/wave-issues/) before they're
filed.

## What a good PR includes

- A short description and the issue it closes.
- All checks above passing locally.
- Tests for new behaviour. Anything touching auth, payments or chain writes
  needs a test for the failure cases, not only the happy path (see
  `tests/auth.test.ts` and `tests/payment.test.ts`).
- `docs/api.md` updated in the same PR when a request or response changes
  (it is the contract with the frontend; the frontend keeps a copy).
- On-chain amounts as `bigint` / decimal strings ending in `Raw`, never
  floats.

## Never commit secrets

No `.env` file, no Stellar secret seeds (`S…`), no API keys or JWT secrets,
in code, tests, fixtures or logs. Tests generate throwaway keys with
`Keypair.random()`. New config goes in `.env.example` with an empty value. If you commit a secret by accident, tell a
maintainer privately (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)) so it can be rotated;
removing it in a later commit is not enough.
