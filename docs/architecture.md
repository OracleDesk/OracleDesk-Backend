# Backend architecture

The backend is the API, indexer and LLM pipeline around the OracleDesk Soroban contracts. The contracts decide everything that matters for money: prices, positions, caps, resolution. The backend never overrides them.

## Request path

Express 5 with helmet, hpp, an env CORS allowlist, rate limits (global, `/auth/*`, `/markets/generate`), JSON bodies capped at 1 MB, and pino logging with secrets redacted. BigInts serialise as decimal strings through the app's JSON replacer. Every response uses the `{ ok, data, error, meta }` envelope. The full contract with the frontend is [api.md](api.md).

## Login (SEP-10 style)

`auth.service.ts` builds a challenge transaction with `WebAuth.buildChallengeTx`, signed by `AUTH_SIGNING_SECRET` (a key that holds nothing and is not the agent key). It stores the transaction hash in Redis for 5 minutes. `/auth/verify` reads the challenge, enforces its time bounds without the SDK's grace period, consumes it atomically (`GETDEL`), checks the user's signature with `verifyChallengeTxSigners`, and issues a JWT. Admin rights are an env allowlist of G-addresses checked server-side.

## Chain access

`services/stellar/clients.ts` builds the generated binding clients. Reads are simulations. Writes go through `chain.service.ts`:

- Agent writes go **through the treasury** (`agent_create_market`, `agent_buy`, `agent_sell`) so its per-trade, per-market and daily caps apply on-chain, plus `reasoning_registry.publish_trace`.
- `dry-run` (default) builds and simulates, logs the result and returns it without signing. `live` signs with `AGENT_SECRET_KEY` via `basicNodeSigner`, and config validation refuses `live` off testnet.
- Contract errors are named from the `Error(Contract, #N)` code in the simulation text through each binding's `Errors` table.

The contracts repo's `agents/stellar/adapter.ts` covers similar ground, but its dry-run doesn't simulate and it lacks `agent_sell`, so this service mirrors its method names instead of depending on it. The intended long-term split is that the agents package owns signing and this repo stays the API, indexer and LLM pipeline (see [contract-requests.md](contract-requests.md)).

## Market creation (ADR 0001)

`market-chain.service.ts` turns a generated proposal into an on-chain market:

1. Build a signer-mode resolution spec (`RESOLUTION_SIGNERS`, default the agent).
2. Hash it as `sha256(XDR(ResolutionSpec))` with the resolver binding's own spec (`lib/resolution-spec.ts`). Tests check this against the contracts repo's Rust `spec-hash` tool.
3. Store the full spec and its hash next to the market, so anyone can later reveal it to `resolver.register_signer_spec`.
4. Pin the canonical question JSON; `question_hash` is the sha256 of those exact bytes and `meta_uri` is `ipfs://<cid>`.
5. Call `treasury.agent_create_market`. In live mode the returned id becomes `onChainMarketId` and the market goes `ACTIVE`; in dry-run it stays `PENDING`.

Backend categories are mapped to the contract enum by `toContractCategory()`.

## Reasoning traces

A trace is canonicalised once (sorted keys, same rules as `agents/core/trace.ts`), pinned byte for byte with Pinata's `pinFileToIPFS`, and `trace_hash` is the sha256 of those bytes. It is published to reasoning-registry once its market is on-chain. `POST /traces/verify` re-fetches the bytes by the on-chain CID and compares them with the on-chain hash, like `x402/trace-verification.ts`.

## Payments

A daily pass is granted only after `payment-verification.service.ts` reads the transaction with Stellar RPC `getTransaction` and confirms all of the following:

- it succeeded;
- it is a single `transfer` on the USDC contract;
- `from` is the logged-in wallet;
- `to` is `PAYMENTS_RECIPIENT`;
- the amount is at least `DAILY_PASS_PRICE_RAW`.

Each hash is usable once (unique `PaymentEvent.txHash`). There is no development bypass; tests inject a fake RPC reader. Per-trace unlocks are sold by the x402 service in the contracts repo, which the frontend calls directly.

## Resolution

Outcomes are decided on-chain by the resolver contract. The backend only reads `resolver.state` and `market_core.get_market`; the old endpoint that let any user set an outcome is gone. When the indexer sees `MarketResolved`, it updates the database and closes positions.

## Indexer

`indexer.service.ts` polls Stellar RPC `getEvents` for the four contract ids every `INDEXER_POLL_MS`:

- Events are decoded with each binding's spec (`Spec.parseEvent`) and stored in `chain_events` keyed by the RPC event id, so re-reads are idempotent.
- The ledger cursor lives in `indexer_cursors`. If it is older than RPC retention (about 7 days on testnet), the indexer warns and resumes from the oldest retained ledger; anything in between is lost to it.
- New `Trade` and `TracePublished` events are pushed to clients over socket.io as `TRADE_EXECUTED` and `REASONING_PUBLISHED`.

## Generated code

`src/generated/` is copied from the pinned `contracts` submodule by `scripts/sync-contracts.mjs`, with a do-not-edit header and `// @ts-nocheck`. CI fails if it's stale.
